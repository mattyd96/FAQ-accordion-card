## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned how to use Sass and the work flow involved. Also gained a better understanding of how css grid works and how you can use divs to your advantage when only wanting certain elements to overflow outside of a div.


### Continued development

I'd like to use what i learned with grid and sass in future projects.
